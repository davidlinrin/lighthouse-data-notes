    "Here's a fun and perhaps surprising statistical riddle, and a good way to get some practice writing python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In a gameshow, contestants try to guess which of 3 closed doors contain a cash prize (goats are behind the other two doors). Of course, the odds of choosing the correct door are 1 in 3. As a twist, the host of the show occasionally opens a door after a contestant makes his or her choice. This door is always one of the two the contestant did not pick, and is also always one of the goat doors (note that it is always possible to do this, since there are two goat doors). At this point, the contestant has the option of keeping his or her original choice, or swtiching to the other unopened door. The question is: is there any benefit to switching doors? The answer surprises many people who haven't heard the question before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can answer the problem by running simulations in Python. We'll do it in several parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, write a function called `simulate_prizedoor`. This function will simulate the location of the prize in many games -- see the detailed specification below:"
